# CTEC 227 Project 2

This project will have you further develop the Blog application from Module 6.

There is a due date within one week of the project due by Sunday, May 14, 2023 at 11:59 PM. Items due by this time will be indicated below.

In addition to the items outlined below, your project must pass HTML validation, CSS validation and must also not contain any WAVE Errors, Contrast Errors or Alerts.

The project must also maintain a consistent user experience across all of the pages.

The application must include all of the following pages:

- blog.php (home page)
- single.php (shows a single blog post)
- tags.php (shows all of the tags being used and each tag is a link to display posts that use that tag)
- categories.php (shows all of the categories used and each category is a link to display all posts that use that tag)
- tag.php (shows all of the posts for a given tag)
- category.php (shows all of the posts for a given category)

## Step 0: Install the application on XAMPP - Due by May 14th, 2023

Here's a list of the things you must do:

- Place this folder in your htdocs folder
- Start XAMPP, Apache and MySQL
- Using phpMyAdmin, create a new database and name it 'blog'. All lowercase.
- Import the SQL from the .sql folder in this repository
- Go to your browser and bring up the blog.php page
- You must submit a screen shot showing these items installed in Canvas by May 14, 2023.

## Step 1: Content Creation - Due by May 14th, 2023

- Your project must remove all of the existing content in each of the tables
- You must create at least 7 meaningful blog posts using phpMyAdmin. No need for a front-end form to do this for this project.
- Use a topic of your choice.
- Make sure that the project contains no remnants of the original content.
- This includes page titles, headings, footers, etc.
- You must submit a screen shot showing these items completed in Canvas by May 14, 2023.

## Step 2: Improve the navbar and make it your own - Due by May 14th, 2023

- The navbar must not look like the one provided.
- Do not remove the 3 links provided (Home, Categories, Tags).
- Style it to match the overall theme you will use for the project.
- You must submit a screen shot showing your improved navbar in Canvas by May 14, 2023.

## Step 3: Improving the Home Page Content Area

- Each blog entry must look professionally styled and not use the default Bootstrap colors provided.
- The unordered lists for the categories must be replaced with comma separated values. If there is only one category, you must display the word "Category". If there are multiple categories you must display the word "Categories".
- Each category must link to the category.php page showing only the blog posts for that category.
- The categories must be in alphabetical order.
- If there is only one tag, you must display the word "Tag". If there are multiple tags you must display the word "Tags".
- The unordered lists for the tags must be replaced with comma, separated values.
- Each tag must link to the tag.php page showing all of the blog entires for just that one tag.
- The tags must be in alphabetical order.
- I would suggest making the code on the blog.php reusable so it can be used on other pages. Consider how to make it driven by a parameter in the URL.

## Step 4: Test Entire Application

- The application must perform without any errors.
- The user interface must be professionally styled and all links must work.
- The application must not contain any HTML/CSS validation errors.
- All WAVE test must not contain any color contrast, errors or alerts.
- Each and every item has been successfully implemented.

## Step 5: Database Export

- Export your blog database and place the .SQL file for your blog in the sql folder.
- The .sql file must be named new_db.sql

## Submission

- Save, stage, commit and push your work to GitHub.
- Make sure you include all of the files and the new SQL file.
